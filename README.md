🍫 Pricing & Production Optimization Analysis
Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes product profitability, pricing efficiency, and factory performance across the chocolate portfolio of the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory.
By combining sales, cost, and production data, the goal is to identify which products and factories drive profit—and where pricing or production decisions can be optimized to improve overall business performance.

🎯 Business Problem

Not all products contribute equally to profitability:

Some high-volume products generate low profit, suggesting potential underpricing

Other products show strong margins but low sales volume, limiting their overall impact

Factories differ significantly in output levels and operational efficiency

Without a clear understanding of these dynamics, pricing and production decisions risk leaving profit unrealized.

🔍 Key Insights
Product Performance

Chocolate bars dominate total sales, with the Milk Chocolate Wonka Bar as the top-selling product

Non-core products (Wonka Gum, Lickable Wallpaper, Kazookles) account for most non-chocolate sales

Many niche products sell in very low volumes and contribute little to overall revenue

Pricing & Profitability

A high selling price does not always translate into high profit

Lickable Wallpaper and Everlasting Gobstopper deliver the highest profit per unit

Core chocolate bars provide stable but mid-range margins

Several products appear underpriced relative to production costs

Factory & Regional Performance

Production is concentrated in Lot’s O’ Nuts and Wicked Choccy’s

Lot’s O’ Nuts is the strongest-performing factory by a wide margin

Pacific and Atlantic regions consistently drive sales growth

Other factories and regions show underutilized capacity
