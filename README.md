Pricing & Production Optimization Analysis

Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory

Project Overview

This project analyzes product profitability, pricing efficiency, and factory performance across Willy Wonka’s chocolate portfolio. By combining sales, cost, and production data, the goal is to identify which products and factories drive profit—and where pricing or production decisions can be optimized to improve overall performance

Business Problem

Not all products contribute equally to profitability:

Some high-volume products generate low profit, suggesting potential underpricing.

Other products show strong margins but low sales volume, limiting their impact.

Factories differ significantly in output and efficiency.

Without a clear view of these dynamics, pricing and production decisions risk leaving profit on the table.

Key Insights
Product Performance

Chocolate bars dominate total sales, with Milk Chocolate Wonka Bar as the top seller.

Non-core products (Wonka Gum, Lickable Wallpaper, Kazookles) account for most non-chocolate sales.

Many niche products sell in very low volumes and contribute little to revenue.

Pricing & Profitability

High selling price does not always equal high profit.

Lickable Wallpaper and Everlasting Gobstopper show the highest profit per unit.

Core chocolate bars deliver steady but mid-range margins.

Several products appear underpriced relative to their production costs.

Factory & Regional Performance

Production is heavily concentrated in Lot’s O’ Nuts and Wicked Choccy’s.

Lot’s O’ Nuts is the strongest performer by a wide margin.

Pacific and Atlantic regions consistently drive sales growth.

Other factories and regions show underutilized capacity.
