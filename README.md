# Pricing and Production Optimization – Willy Wonka Dataset

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Willy Wonka chocolate sales and production data to identify **which products and factories drive profit—and which reduce it**. The focus is on profitability rather than sales volume, supporting better **pricing, production, and portfolio decisions**.

---

## Business Challenge

Wonka produces many chocolate products across multiple factories and regions, but:

* Some high-selling products generate **low profit**
* Some high-margin products sell **too little**
* Factory efficiency and product mix vary

Without clear insights, it is difficult to optimize pricing, production allocation, and product strategy.

---

## Analytical Objective

The goal is to understand **which products make money, which don’t, and why**, in order to:

* Identify most and least profitable products
* Detect underpriced high-volume items
* Find high-margin products with growth potential
* Compare factory-level profitability
* Recommend data-driven pricing and production actions

---

## Key Hypotheses

* Best-selling products may be **underpriced**
* High-margin products may need **better marketing or distribution**
* Profitability differs by **factory efficiency**
* **Premium products** outperform basic bars
* Profit varies by **region or shipping mode**

---

## Expected Impact

This analysis enables Wonka to:

* Adjust prices confidently
* Shift production toward profitable items
* Improve marketing focus
* Reduce or discontinue weak performers
* Increase profit without relying solely on higher sales volume
